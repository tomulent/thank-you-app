		<p> Thank you so much for this awesome opportunity. Even though it was last minute, you allowed me to push myself beyond belief at YEI. This was one of the highlights of my summer and I have had such a great time with all the kids. I have always had a lot of respect for you, but this experience multiplied it by 10. You work so incredibly hard and it was an honor to be able to hang out with you. Also, thank you for being so accommodating and supportive. 
		<p> P.S. Dean thanks you as well. He said hanging out at YEI was one of the best experiences of his life and has made him determined to attend college. </p>
		<p> You're awesome.</p>

		<p>Thank you so much for putting together YEI. Your hard work and dedication to GIIP as well as the YEI Program is unfathomable! It is truly amazing what you have been able to do with these students in a matter of days. You inspire me to do great things with technology and the community. I hope you had as much fun, or more, as I did this past week! Thank you for also letting me help counsel, guide, and teach the YEI-ers! This has been a great experience and I think YEI has been nothing short of a success!!</p>
